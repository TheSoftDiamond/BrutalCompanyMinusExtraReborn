February 4, 2025: 
TO DO: Add player amount scaling for difficulty
TO DO: Fix up Tree events (either by LOD, lowering tree amount, etc)
SUGGESTION: Dust pan should not be a neutral event. May make more rare, or move to bad possibly.
Unknown if Fixed; ShipLightsFailure/ShipCoreFailure seem to cause crash on older BCM(E) mods.
Unknown if fixed: Lingering events (was present in BCM. Not sure if present in BCMER too)
Unknown if fixed: Scrap transmutation weight bug. Was present in BCM, may or may not be in BCMER.
TO DO: Better custom event system
